# TypeScript Basic Types

Practice exercise for TypeScript basic types, interfaces, generics, and more.

## Running this exercise

From the **root** of the monorepo:
```bash
npm install  # First time only
npm start -w @code-playground/ts-basic-types
```

Or navigate to this directory:
```bash
cd exercises/typescript/basic-types
npm install  # First time only
npm start
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Compile and run (does both automatically!)
- `npm run build` - Only compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm run dev` - Watch mode (auto-recompile on file changes)

## What's covered

- Primitive types (string, number, boolean)
- Arrays and Tuples
- Enums
- Interfaces
- Functions with type annotations
- Generics
- Union types
- Type aliases

## Tips

- Edit `src/index.ts` to practice different TypeScript features
- Use `npm run dev` to auto-compile as you code
- The compiled output goes to the `dist/` directory
